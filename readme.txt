= How can I add  Survey to my site multiple times? = Just be sure to specify different label text, eg **[powr-survey label='MY LABEL 1']**, **[powr-survey label='MY LABEL 2']** for each time you use the plugin

= Why do you require me to sign up? = Signing up is what allows us to track which plugins are yours, and allows you to edit them right in your page.

To temporarily hide it, click on your page and then type 'p + down arrow' (the letter p followed by the down arrow). You can show the icon again by typing 'p + up-arrow'.

= I can't see the settings icon anymore, what happened? = You are just logged out of POWr.io. You can show the icon again by typing 'p + up-arrow'.
